  __________________________________
 I have a bachelor's degree in Information Technology.

I found my passion in data science soon after I finished my bachelor's degree. I then decided to take the next step and enroll in a few courses for data science. My most recent course was at LearningFuze. Here, I was able to gain the knowledge and skills that I need to further my career in the data science field.

Outside of my technical qualifications. I always bring a professional and friendly work environment with me.   
  

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a dataset about Gender and Age Detection. With only one image I should be able to predict whether the person in the image is a female or male and their age range. Check back in for updates.  
  

- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about SQL and Neural Networking.  
  

- 🤔 I’m always looking for advice with everything related to data science. If you have any suggestions or even fun and helpful tips let me know! ...  
  

- 💬 Ask me about how I got into data science or about python.  
  

- ⚡ Fun facts: I am currently learning Spanish. | ⭐ Neutron stars can spin at a rate of 600 rotations per second.
  

- 🦁 Where you can find me: Usually watching Netflix or hiking.
